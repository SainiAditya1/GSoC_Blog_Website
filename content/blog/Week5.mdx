## This week I started development GPML to CX2 converter in which our aim is to convert GPML files to CX2 format.

## The GPML to CX2 converter is a crucial component of our project as it allows us to import biological pathways from external sources and visualize them in our application.

## The converter will enable users to upload GPML files and convert them to CX2 format, which can then be visualized using our project's visualization capabilities.

## Repository for the GPML to CX2 converter can be found [here](https://github.com/SainiAditya1/gpml-to-cx2)
