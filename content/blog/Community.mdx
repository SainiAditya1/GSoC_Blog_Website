I had my first Community Bonding Meeting on 10 May, In this meeting, we discussed several things like a timeline of the project, the Contributor-Mentor Agreement, and we have discussed
the approaches we can use for libGPML -> libGPML.js We discussed two approaches

### 1. Write it from scratch

More robust but can be difficult to keep both libraries in sync

### 2. Use a compiler/transpiler such as j2cl

Easier to keep both libraries in sync but more unstable implementation

Both approaches have their pros and cons But we have not reached a final decision as the secondary mentor is not able to attend the meet

Hopefully, next Friday (17 May) we will choose the best possible approach for libGPML -> libGPML.js.
