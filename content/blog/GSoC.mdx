Hello everyone! I am excited to share my journey and experiences with Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024. I hope this post will provide some insights and motivation for those who are considering applying for the next GSoC.

# What is Google Summer of Code?

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.

# How I Got Started

My journey began when I first heard about GSoC from a senior in my college. The idea of contributing to open source projects and working with experienced developers from around the world intrigued me.

# My Preparation

I started by exploring the GSoC website and the list of participating organizations. I looked for projects that matched my interests and skills. I spent time understanding the project's codebase and started contributing small patches.

# Application Process

The application process was quite rigorous. I had to submit a proposal detailing how I plan to implement the project. I also had to demonstrate my understanding of the codebase and my ability to contribute effectively in this my mentor [Hasan Balci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasan-balc%C4%B1-52490bb4/) helped me throughout the process.

# My Project

I was fortunate enough to be selected by National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) for the project GPML Support in Newt. The goal of this project is to add new functionalities to Newt to be able to create biological maps in GPML format from scratch or edit existing ones. This will provide users to have a web-based alternative to PathVisio where they can easily create/edit GPML maps from any computer with Internet access. The functionalities to be added will also include access to WikiPathways, easy identifier mapping and data visualization etc., as in PathVisio.

# Conclusion

Participating in GSoC was a transformative experience. I would encourage all students who love coding to consider applying for GSoC. It's a great opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to the open source community.

I am grateful to Google for organizing this program and to National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) for giving me this opportunity. I look forward to continuing my contributions to open source projects and hopefully, mentoring future GSoC students.

I hope you found this post helpful. If you have any questions about GSoC or my project, feel free to reach out to me. Happy coding!
